            Hi there, and thank you for agreeing to participate in this survey!<sup>*</sup> Our client is looking to tailor their catalog of hilarious, novelty gifts to reflect the values and tastes of a changing customer base.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each round, we'll display three, randomly-generated products from the store's catalog. Please select your favorite and/or least-disliked product of the three, then click "Submit Choice" to proceed to the next round.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you've made 25 choices, you'll be redirected to the results page, where you can see the data from your survey, as well as the data from all surveys collected up to that point,including yours. Many marketing firms would consider this data to be "valuable trade secrets," but we here at Smoot & Associates value <em>transparency</em>, <em>collaboration</em>, and <em>extremely low overhead</em> over data security and/or information architecture of any kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy clicking!
